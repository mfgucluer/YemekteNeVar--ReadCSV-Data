# YemekteNeVar-ReadData
"What's for Lunch?" application is a mobile application that I created by reading the monthly menus in the CVS file published by Ankara University's SKS cafeteria. 

In this project, I tried to reflect the Food Menu data I took from the CVS file to my mobile app. I also solved various bugs by trying it with data from many different months.

What I learned with this project:

1- How to get data from CVS file with Swift UIkit
2- How to write a user-friendly application for the user by using and processing the captured data
